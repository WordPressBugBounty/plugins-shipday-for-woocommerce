== Description ==
Support fast, efficient, and affordable local deliveries for your WooCommerce store with Shipday. Our intuitive mobile apps and web dashboard make it easy for you to automatically dispatch on-demand or scheduled orders, identify the best delivery route, and track drivers in real time.

You can use your own delivery drivers or leverage a third-party delivery service like **DoorDash** and **Uber** (only available in the US)—all from one unified platform. It’s free to start and works anywhere in the world with internet connectivity.

Shipday integrates directly with WooCommerce. When a customer places a delivery order on your WooCommerce store, the order is automatically sent to Shipday for dispatch, route planning, and live delivery tracking. We support both single-vendor stores and multi-vendor marketplaces built with **Dokan** and **WCFM**.

### Delivery date & time slots on the checkout page

Give your customers full control over **when** they receive their order.

With Shipday’s datetime configuration, now you can show a **delivery date and time slot selector directly on the WooCommerce checkout page**. Customers simply pick an available delivery day and time window before placing their order, and their selection is sent to Shipday together with the order details.

As a merchant, you can:

- Configure which **days of the week** are available for delivery (e.g. weekdays only, or specific days).
- Define flexible **time slots** (e.g. 10:00 AM – 11:00 AM, 12:00 PM – 03:00 PM, etc.).
- Manage everything through a **simple calendar-style UI**, without touching code.

👉 **This delivery date & time slot functionality is included for free with Shipday – there is no additional charge to use it.**

If you already use a dedicated date/time plugin, Shipday is also compatible with popular WooCommerce date and time picker solutions, so you can keep your existing checkout UX and still benefit from real-time dispatch and tracking via Shipday.

### Ideal for fast local delivery

Shipday is ideal for managing fast on-demand or scheduled deliveries for your online business, including:

- Restaurant delivery
- Prepared meal delivery
- Quick convenience delivery
- Grocery delivery
- 15-minute / rapid grocery delivery
- Pharmacy delivery
- Other food deliveries
- Flower delivery
- Local courier delivery
- And many other local delivery use cases we see every day

### Key benefits

- **All-in-one dispatch app**
  View incoming orders with pickup and delivery information, automatically or manually dispatch drivers, and see real-time driver locations on a live map.

- **Easy driver management with the driver app**
  With the Shipday driver app, drivers receive order notifications instantly, navigate to pickup and drop-off, communicate with customers via text or phone, and capture proof of delivery with photos or signatures.

- **Real-time delivery tracking for customers**
  Shipday sends customers a live delivery tracking link via SMS, so they can follow their driver on a map and see up-to-the-minute ETAs—reducing “Where is my order?” calls and improving customer satisfaction.

- **Flexible delivery setup**
  Use only your own drivers, only third-party fleets (like DoorDash or Uber in supported regions), or a mix of both—Shipday helps you orchestrate everything from one place.
